# How to develop in this project

## Setup
- run `npm install` to install all dependencies

### Running commands
You can run all commands in development using `npm run dev -- <command>`. Examples:
- `npm run dev -- --help` to see all available commands
- `npm run dev -- code:push` to deploy your code

### For monday devs
In case you need to work against our dev env in Okteto, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` (mind the `APPS_DOMAIN` env variable there)
